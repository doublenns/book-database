# Go Library

## A simple CLI app written in Golang for managing a database of books (library)

### TODO
* Refactor functions to be more easily testable
* Add tests
* Implement more generic functions and interfaces to make code more DRY

## Info

Run `go build` to create the "book-database" executable. Then run the executable to run the program

## Notes
* Two 3rd party golang pkgs are downloaded from github as dependencies, as specified in the go.mod
* This program writes a file `library.json` to disk and manages it's contents
